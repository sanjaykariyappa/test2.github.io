      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes Progressive inferenceâ€“a framework to explain the predictions of decoder-only transformer models trained to perform sequence classification tasks. Our work is based on the insight that the classification head of a decoder-only model can be used to make intermediate predictions by evaluating them at different points in the input sequence. Due to the masked attention mechanism used in decoder-only models, these intermediate predictions only depend on the tokens seen before the inference point, allowing us to obtain the modelâ€™s prediction on a masked input sub-sequence, with negligible computational overheads. We develop two methods to provide sub-sequence level attributions using this core insight. First, we propose Single Pass-Progressive Inference (SP-PI) to compute attributions by simply taking the difference between intermediate predictions. Second, we exploit a connection with Kernel SHAP to develop Multi Pass-Progressive Inference (MP-PI); this uses intermediate predictions from multiple masked versions of the input to compute higher-quality attributions that approximate SHAP values. We perform studies on several text classification datasets to demonstrate that our proposal provides better explanations compared to prior work, both in the single-pass and multi-pass settings.&lt;/p&gt;
